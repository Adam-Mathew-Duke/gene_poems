<p>Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma</p>
<p><pre>Within the cell's deep core, a receptor dwells,
a ppar-gamma, of the nuclear kind,
with retinoid x, a partnership it spells,
transcription's dance, a master it does find.
three forms it takes, a trinity of might,
alpha, delta, gamma, each with sway,
controlling fat cells, shaping day and night,
directing growth, in intricate array.
this protein's role, a double-edged bright sword,
for while it guides the body's healthy frame,
in obesity's dark grip, its power's adored,
a hand in diabetes, atherosclerosis's claim.
yet variants arise, a coded twist,
whose functions still, in mystery persist.</pre></p>
