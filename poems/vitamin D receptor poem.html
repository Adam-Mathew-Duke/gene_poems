<h1>Vitamin d receptor poem</h1>
<p><pre>The vdr gene, a master's subtle hand,
controls the sun's gift, vitamin d's grace,
a nuclear receptor, in the land
of transcription, finds its rightful place.
it binds the bile, a lithocholic key,
unlocking pathways, mineral and more,
immune response, and cancer's mystery,
its influence extends to every shore.
but mutations rise, a shadowed blight,
type ii rickets, a crippling despair,
a single change, obscuring sun's bright light,
a shifted start, a burden hard to bear.
yet isoforms arise, in varied guise,
with read-through's gift, new functions still surprise.</pre></p>
