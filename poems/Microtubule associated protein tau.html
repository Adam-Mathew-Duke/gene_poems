<p>Microtubule associated protein tau</p>
<p><pre>A tangled thread, the mapt gene's design,
splices its script in ways both strange and deep,
creating mrnas, a varied line,
where nervous cells their secrets softly keep.
in youthful growth, or age's slow decline,
its message shifts, a rhythm hard to reap,
reflecting neuron type, a subtle sign,
while silent errors in its structure sleep.
but should those errors wake, a shadow falls,
and tangled tau, a protein gone astray,
unravels mind, and memory enthralls,
in alzheimer's grasp, or pick's disease's sway.
frontotemporal blight, or palsy's creeping hand,
these are the fates a faulty code command.</pre></p>
