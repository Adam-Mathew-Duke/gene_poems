<p>Bcl2 associated x, apoptosis regulator</p>
<p><pre>A silent war within the cellular core,
where bax, a protein, plays a deadly part,
with bcl2 bound, a balance to restore,
or break, and seal a cell's departing heart.
a dimer's dance, a life or death decree,
apoptotic sway, a shadowed fate,
the ratio's key, for all the world to see,
to judge the cell's precarious estate.
through vdac's gate, a channel to the void,
cytochrome c escapes, the signal sent,
membrane potential lost, the battle's joined,
by p53's hand, its grim design is lent.
    multiple forms, this actor takes its stage,
    in life's grand drama, turning fate's dark page.</pre></p>
